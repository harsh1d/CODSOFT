🌟 Task Completed: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game! 🎮✂️📃✊ 🌟

I'm thrilled to share my recent accomplishment as part of my Python Programming Internship with @CODSOFT! This fun and interactive game, built using Python, challenges users to play the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game while tracking scores across multiple rounds! 🎉🐍

🎯 Key Features:

User Input: Players can choose between rock, paper, or scissors. 🪨📄✂️

🤖 Smart Opponent: The computer generates its choice randomly.

🕹️ Game Logic: Based on classic rules—rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.

📊 Results Display: Clear winner/loser/tie message with lots of emojis for a fun experience! 😁🎈

🔢 Score Tracking: Users can keep tabs on scores across multiple rounds!

♻️ Replay Option: Players can easily play again for endless fun! 🎯

💡 This project taught me valuable coding practices and enhanced my skills in logic building, user interaction, and Python programming. 🧑‍💻✨

🔗 I’ve uploaded the project on GitHub for everyone to explore: [Insert GitHub Link]. If you're interested, feel free to check it out and share your feedback! 🙌💻

📽️ A demo of my project is available here: [Insert Demo Video Link].

🛠️ This experience has been an incredible journey, thanks to @CODSOFT for the opportunity. I’m looking forward to tackling the next tasks!
