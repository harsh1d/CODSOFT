🎉 Just completed Task 1: Creating a To-Do List using Python! 🐍
It was an incredibly easy and fun project to dive into. With just a few lines of code, I was able to: 
✅ Add tasks dynamically 
✅ View tasks in a structured format 
✅ Remove completed tasks
This beginner-friendly project not only helped me improve my coding skills but also showed how powerful yet simple Python can be. 💻
If you're new to coding, this is a great place to start. Python truly makes programming an enjoyable journey! 🚀
Looking forward to tackling more projects and learning every day! 🙌

Stay tuned for updates as I embark on this amazing experience! 🚀
